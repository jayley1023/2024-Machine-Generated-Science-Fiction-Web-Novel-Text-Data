该数据集包含由采用ERNIE bot、豆包、Kimi和Qwen（2024年10月版本模型）等大型语言模型生成的小说章节片段组成，每个模型生成了20万词的独立文本，共计80万字，提示词基于人类撰写的科幻网络小说构建而成。
人类文本取自国内网络文学平台“起点中文网”“阅文”，选取了6部具有代表性的网络长篇小说，覆盖了六个不同的科幻子类型，包括“末世废土”“星际战争”“科技升级”“赛博朋克”“灵气复苏”及“科幻惊悚”，所有作品均来自中腰部作者，从这6部长篇小说中，分别节选了各3万余字的连续章节，构成总计约20万字的人类参照语料库。
This dataset comprises novel chapter fragments generated by large language models including ERNIE bot, Doubao, Kimi, and Qwen (October 2024 model versions). Each model produced 200,000 words of independent text, totaling 800,000 words. Prompts were constructed based on human-written science fiction web novels.
Human texts were sourced from the domestic online literature platform “Qidian Chinese Network,” featuring six representative web novels spanning six distinct sci-fi subgenres: “Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland,” “Interstellar Warfare,” “Tech Advancement,” cyberpunk,“ ”spiritual energy revival,“ and ”sci-fi thriller." All works originate from mid-tier authors. Over 30,000 words of consecutive chapters were extracted from each of these six novels, forming a total human reference corpus of approximately 200,000 words.
